Wow my brain found this assignment to be such a puzzle. I was super grateful to chatgpt for helping me visualize and explain each error in the console log for me when I got lost. 

I have been really into anime and manga since my other online class is Manga and Anime Art History. I always find the elements personal elements we get to include into of each assignemnt such a nice break from the frustration of problem solving but it also gives me easier visuals that I enjoy seeing. These elements of the homework always help me a lot.

The JSON data I used wasn't from the list but from another GitHub file by asarode https://github.com/asarode/anime-list/blob/master/data/data.json

I foudn the "Hype" numbers in the data to be the most interesting so with chatgpt's examples I was able to create a filter using the "Hype" numbers for each data point!

When I code I still feel very out of place and lost most the time. Although i ethically find Chatgpt and AI to be harmful to the environment I am havppy to use it sparingly to aid me in my learning and growth as a coder.
