For this weeks assignement we didn't have the full week like usual since the assignemnet was open to us on Thursday and it is due the following Monday. I was a bit of a time crunch and cound't ask for an extension since that wouldn't have helped me much due to other homework and events taking place next week.

Because of this I feel as though I rushed the assignement and used AI to explain a lot of what was going on. Luckily I had experience with html5 from my previous creative coding classes. AI was so helpgul in breaking down and explaining thing and helping me with the math within the code.

I also had some help from someone who has experience with code to help break down more of the math and explain how I should use a class to create the code to work better.

The comments on this assignement are not all mine. I was stuggling to organize my code and feeling overwhelemed so I asked chatgpt to break the code down for me using comments and it really helped me to stay organized and focused!
