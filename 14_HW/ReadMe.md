I was battling this project for a while. I stuggled a lot with making sure threejs was on my computer and put into my code properly!
I kept having to have chatgpt help me and they wanted me to do in through a CDN but it wouldn't work! I eventually looked at your code to get the proper js. files to
complete the 3dmodels! I am very grateful for chat GPT since i was unable to get help from peers this week.

My model is a bee that I made from my Creative Coding 2 class that I had two semesters ago! I love that bee cause I made it in illustrator.

This week was difficultbecause I had to input a new tool. This has not been a stuggle in the past adding in plugins so I was unsure how to even began problem slovling but luckily chatGPT was able to explain all the console logs!
