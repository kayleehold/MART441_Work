The things I did for this project are 
1)Change the gravity, so each star has gravity.
2)Use different sprites for the player - look in the assets folder.
3)For a non-violent style game, you could make it a speed-run and challenge them to collect the stars as quickly as possible.
4)Add more platforms.
5)Add a new level if they collect all the stars (or whatever you have on the screen). 

Althought I missed adding the level we are on from task 5 due to time but overall this project was so so fun! I had chat gpt help me with some mistakes but this was so cool to see the assets I pick move and pop up with phaser.io!

I didn't event have to have a peer help me so I felt super accomplished!
