This assignement was a very difficult one for me. I used ChatGPT for the first time this semester cause I was struggling so much to understand what I was doing wrong and how to do JQuery. Once I got the bases codes from ChatGPT I was able to code my own stuff and it was then really fun.

I do still morally disagree with how harmful AI can be for the environement but I do agree that it can be used for good and its a helpful tool to support people learning something new like code. I think when AI is used to support learning instead of doing the critical development and thinking for you, its a great tool.

I know I was unable to accomplish all that the assigsnment required but depside really struggling with coding and this assigenment I am proud of what I do accomplish and create.

I had fun getting quotes and images too! I always like adding myself into the project. It allows me to take a bit of a break from the difficult problem solving coding provides during these assigenments at times.
