This was challeneging when I first started and I got lots of help but overall I was proud of the work. The JavaScript took sometime to read and understand looking at your code example but the example helped a ton!

I think AI would have been very helpful in helping me undsterstand and break down the code in a way I might understand. This code is important, not to just build games but to do things like build testing for science experiments.

I just recently saw some testing on telephapy! (The posdcast is called "The Telepathy Tapes") and they use card matching and random number generators just like the ones we build!
