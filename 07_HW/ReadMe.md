This assigment at first glance and description seemed too difficlut and complex but after going through this weeks modules it was super easy. I had someone sit down with me who knows code better then I do listen through as I explained what was happening in the example for this week and it was a great way to start the assignment and break it down.

In this example I think AI would have quickly written this for me which would be helpful but in regards to finding the images for this class I think the human aspect of choosing the images would be something I think AI would choose for me and I would have lost so much of the knowledge I earned from looking for photos myself. The discovery in 
part of the journey but AI can make things much quicker. 

I think AI would have explained the assigenment well if I asked it to break down the example but having someone to sit with me to talk through the assigment is something AI couldn't have done as well. The person challeneged me and my thinking and AI can't really do that cause it does not know me on a personal level nor does it have a personality of its own to bounce knowlege and conversation off of.
