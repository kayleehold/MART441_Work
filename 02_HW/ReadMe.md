Hi Cassens, 

This assignement was fun and a good practice for me to get back into coding since I haven't done it since your Creative Coding 2 Class two semesters ago!

Although I see how using AI can be helpful for coding and insightful for this class, I morally resent the use of it for it being very harmful to the planet and using vast amounts of water to support its function. 

I hope to only have to use AI technology when absoulety necessay to help me in an assignemnt so I will not be comparing the two for this week's homework. I hope you can understand!
